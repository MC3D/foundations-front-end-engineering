Today's class will focus on the CSS "Box Model" and typography, as well as revisit a few HTML attributes that can have a big impact on accessibility.

Today's Learning Objectives
Today we'll cover these learning objectives. By the end of today, you'll be able to

explain why coding for accessibility is important
identify common accessibility strategies when producing HTML pages
use child selectors for targeted styling of sequential content
apply font styles to elements such as size, color, family, style, and decoration
explain the box model and how height, width, border, margin, and padding effect it
calculate “total” dimensions of an HTML element using the standard box model
As you attend the lecture and lab, read these notes, and work on your homework, keep these learning objectives top of mind. If you're having difficulty with any of the objectives, make sure to ask questions!

HTML Accessibility
Learning to create accessible web pages is a big topic, and in this course we'll only scratch the surface. However, a little bit of effort can go a really long way. For example, in the previous lesson we briefly mentioned that semantic HTML can dramatically improve the experience for people using assistive technology, such as screen readers.

A similar "small" change with a big impact is learning to use the alt and title HTML attributes properly.

The 'alt' Attribute
The alt attribute is often misunderstood, but the concept is simple: it provides alternate text describing an image when that image cannot be displayed. One of the most common use cases is screen readers.

Because a screen reader application has no reasonable way to analyze and describe the contents of an image, you as the author of the content can provide a short, helpful description.

```
<img src="cookies-book.jpg" alt="Front cover of '100 Cookies from the Iron Age'">
```

Here are a few helpful hints:

Every image should have alt attributes
Images that are purely decorative should have a blank value: alt="" (this is fairly rare, as most images of this nature are CSS backgrounds)
Avoid redundant phrases like "An image of...". It's implied that an image is being described. Specifying a kind of image may make sense, however: "An illustration of..", "A diagram of...", "A photograph of..."
If you've never used a screen reader, now is a great time to try it out. It's an enlightening experience. If you're on Windows, the NVDA screen reader is a popular, free screen reader that's worth a download. If you're on a Mac, check out the documentation for the built-in VoiceOver tool.

The 'title' attribute
While you may find examples of elements with identical values for alt  and title attributes, they're not the same. title values provide tooltips that display when the mouse is over the element, and may be added to img elements, as well as paragraphs, quotations, links, and more.

Do not rely on the title attribute for accessibility. Some screen readers don't support the title attribute and those that do, don't read the title attribute by default. It requires changing a setting for the title to be read, which not all users do.

Note: Use of the title attribute is highly problematic for many users:

People using touch-only devices
People navigating with keyboards
People navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as screen readers or magnifiers
People experiencing fine motor control impairments
People with cognitive concerns.
CSS Typography Basics
As web typography has become more refined over the last few years, it's grown increasingly easy to add beautiful typographic styles. Even with these refinements, there are still a few workhorse CSS properties you'll want to master early on:

font-size is used to change the size of text in an element. It expects a numeric value along with a unit (px, em, rem)
text-transform is a great way to change the capitalization. Values include capitalize, lowercase, uppercase, and initial
text-decoration is primarily used with the underline and line-through values to create underlined and "strike through" effects
font-style is almost always to italicize text
font-family expects a list of fonts to "try" from left to right. More on this below.
line-height defines the space above and below a line of text. It expects a numeric value along with a unit of measurement using px, em, rem, etc.
letter-spacing defines the space between each letter in an element and accepts the same values as line-height
The last three in this list can be pretty confusing at first, so let's break them down in the following diagrams:

If you've ever used a program like Adobe InDesign, or worked on print projects, some of these concepts are probably familiar to you, but the terms may not be. If so, this may help:

Think of line-height as the printing term leading.
Think of letter-spacing as kerning.
Think of font-size as point size.
The CSS Box Model
Bounding boxes are a part of the box model used for specifying the size and position of all HTML elements. All HTML elements are rendered in the document as a box with a certain width and height. Each element's box is made up of a series of smaller nested boxes.

There are four parts that make up each element's bounding box, each of which can be sized using CSS properties.

Content Box
First, the content box is where text, images, and other elements will appear. This is the innermost box and can be sized using the width and height properties.

Border Box
Next, the border box is the area that marks the visual edge of the content box. The background-color property of the content box, for example, will not extend beyond the border. The border's width, color, and style can be adjusted all at once using the single border shorthand property, or individually using border-width, border-style and border-color.

INSTRUCTOR DEMO

Margin Box
Last, but not least, the margin box is the blank space between the border box of the element and the next HTML element. Margins are similar to padding but are positioned outside of the visual area of the element. Margins can be styled using the margin property;  it is shorthand for setting all individual margins at once: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and  margin-left.
