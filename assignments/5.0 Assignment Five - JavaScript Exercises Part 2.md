## Lesson 5 Assignment

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills of a professional web developer is the ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. This is what you will be doing over the course of 6 evenings.

Since the topics we covered in class today do not directly relate to the project you've been working on, tonight your homework will look a little different.

This is the assignment for day 5.

### Details

Today, you will work through some JavaScript exercises to help drive home the concepts of functions. Feel free to use [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to look for any help as you work through these exercises.

Download the [exercises.js](js/exercises.js) file and add it to your project. Complete each exercise - there are 4 - and use the browser's console to check your work.

### Deliverables

* Push your work to GitHub
* Submit the link to your GitHub project directory in Slack
