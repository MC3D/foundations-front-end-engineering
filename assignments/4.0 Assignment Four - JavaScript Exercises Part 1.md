## Lesson 4 Assignment

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills of a professional web developer is the ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. This is what you will be doing over the course of 6 evenings.

This is the assignment for day 4.

### Details

First off, take some time to browse through MDN's JavaScript Section. It can be hard to read through at first, but try to at least begin to familiarize yourself with it. This will likely become one of the most powerful resources in the future as you continue to dive deeper into web development.

Secondly, download the attached exercises_one.js file and add it to your project. Edit the code section so each assert passes. Use the browser's console to check your code. There should be no errors in the console.

Thirdly, continue to use the mockup you were given on day one, and fill in any gaps in your HTML or CSS that you may have missed previously.

### Deliverables

* Push your work to GitHub
* Submit the link to your GitHub project directory in Slack
