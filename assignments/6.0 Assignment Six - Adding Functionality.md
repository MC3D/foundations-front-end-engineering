## Lesson 6 Assignment

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills of a professional web developer is the ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. This is what you will be doing over the course of the next 6 evenings.

In this assignment, you will finish your final project by adding some functionality to what you've already built.
This is the assignment for lesson 6.

### Details

Using the mockup you were given on day 1, you are going to add functionality to your website.

There are two pieces of functionality you should add. The first one is *required*, and the second one is a *bonus*.

#### REQUIRED

Each time a user clicks the `BUY NOW!` button:

* The button's text should briefly change to `ADDED TO THE CART!`
* The count of items in the cart - top right of the screen - should increase by one

#### BONUS
