## Lesson 3 Assignment

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills of a professional web developer is the ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. This is what you will be doing over the course of 6 evenings.

This is the assignment for day 3.

### Details

Using the mockup you were given on day 1, use CSS layout techniques to position the elements on the page.

You shouldn't have to write much HTML tonight, but you may refactor your code if if makes sense to do so. Tonight, focus on adding CSS and moving your elements into the correct position. Once this is done, your website will be mostly complete, minus the functionality of the tabbed area and the "add to cart" button. You'll work on those items once we've covered JavaScript.

### Deliverables

* Push your work to GitHub
* Submit the link to your GitHub project directory in Slack
