## Lesson 2 Assignment

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills of a professional web developer is the ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. This is what you will be doing over the course of 6 evenings.

This is the assignment for day 2.

### Details

Using the mockup you were given on day 1, and create the HTML and CSS for the following:

* Tabbed content area
* Related product area

We still haven't covered layout yet or how to move elements around, so for tonight just focus on writing the HTML for each area and adding some basic styles to it. Make sure you start to get your elements laid out properly using margin, padding, etc.

### Deliverables

* Push your work to GitHub
* Submit the link to your GitHub project directory in Slack
